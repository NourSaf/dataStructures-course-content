In each episode, Dog and/or one of his friends embarks on a series of adventures where the only way to save the day is to build or un-build words. The show's novelty is that when a word is built correctly, it morphs into the thing it represents, which gives instant meaning to the word. WordWorld has been translated into popular mobile applications, Internet-based games, magnetic plush and other toys.\n\nWordWorld currently airs in 90 countries and 10 languages. It premiered September 3, 2007 on PBS Kids and is currently in its third season, with 84 11-minute episodes. WordWorld currently broadcasts on PBS Kids it is produced for WTTW Chicago.",

Dekker plays Bat Masterson, who after failing to secure a job as a newspaper reporter becomes marshal of Dodge City. Preferring socializing to peacekeeping, Masterson falls in love with Dora Hand (Claire Trevor), the obligatory golden-hearted chorus girl whose concern for the welfare of her fellow citizens at time reaches Madonna-like dimensions. When Dora is shot down cattle baron King Kennedy (Barry Sullivan), Masterson begins taking his job seriously. After taking care of Kennedy, Masterson determines to enshrine the memory of Dora, whose efforts to clean up Dodge City were largely ignored by the \"decent\" townsfolk.",

Between 1861 and 1865, this epic American story of struggle and survival was written in blood, and in this series is told mostly from first-hand accounts and in the spoken words of the participants themselves, through their diaries, letters, and memoirs. The series concludes with Lee's surrender at Appomattox Court House and the surrender of the western Confederate Army to Sherman in North Carolina in the spring of 1865. It then explores the legacy of slavery and the consequences and meaning of a war that transformed the country forever.",

Many believe the Mothman to be a 1960’s phenomenon, an omen only appearing before tragedy, and disappearing after a flap of sightings and the subsequent Silver Bridge collapse in 1967. But what if there’s more? What if the origins of this omen trace back much further and go much deeper than anyone realized? And what if…the sightings never ended?",

Jesse, who is fond of snowboarding, teaches the wolf to be his partner in skijoring, a sport in which a dog is used to haul a man on skis. John Rockwell the owner of a ranch, has different plans for the animal; he sees the wolf as a threat to his stock and is determined to see that the animal is put down.",

Prevented from receiving needed supplies that would have ended the war nine months earlier, freed the death camps, and prevented Russian invasion of the Eastern Bloc, and Stalin's murderous rampage. Why was he fired as General of the Third Army and relegated to a governorship of post-war Bavaria? Who were his enemies? Was he a threat to Eisenhower, Montgomery, Churchill, and Bradley? And is it possible as some say that the General's freakish collision with an Army truck, on the day before his departure for US, was not really an accident? Or was Patton not only dismissed by his peers, but the victim of an assassin's bullet at their behest? Was his personal silence necessary?",

Asai Kei and Haruki Misora work for their school’s club called \"Houshi\" club, which execute any missions received from the Kanrikyoku. Misora has the ability to reset the world 3 days. This means that all events and any memory of the past 3 days that \"could have\" happened, never happened. Kei has the ability to \"remember\" the past. Even after Misora uses her powers to reset the world back 3 days, Kei will retain those 3 days in his memory. Combining their powers, these two solve missions issued by the Kanrikyoku.",

En route to Texas, Gene discovers the infestation and is assigned by the Forest Department to supervise the program of spraying the area with DDT from the air.

Buford, he fought at First Bull Run, was wounded at Shiloh, and served as a Confederate spy. But Buford harbored a secret-he was really Loreta Velazquez, a Cuban immigrant from New Orleans. By 1863, Velazquez was spying for the Union. She scandalized America when she revealed her story in her 1876 memoir, The Woman in Battle. Attacked not only for her criticism of war, but her sexuality and social rule-breaking, Velazquez was dismissed as a hoax for 150 years. But evidence confirms she existed, one of over 1,000 women soldiers who served in the Civil War. What made her so dangerous she was erased from history?",

        "description": "Paula's Home Cooking is a Food Network show hosted by Paula Deen. Deen's primary culinary focus was Southern cuisine and familiar comfort food that is popular with Americans. In the show, classic dishes such as pot roast, fried okra, fried chicken and pecan pie were the norm, and overly complicated or eccentric recipes were usually eschewed. Dishes that are flavorful and familiar were spotlighted, although the fat content and calorie count of the meals were often very high. Paula also showed off vignettes of Savannah, Georgia, where she co-owns with her sons Jamie and Bobby, The Lady & Sons.\n\nDeen's popularity, spurred by the show, led to a small role in the feature film Elizabethtown.\n\nDespite its seemingly Southern atmosphere, Paula's Home Cooking was taped in upstate New York until 2006; since then, shows had been taped at Deen's new home near Savannah. In 2008, Deen began work on a revamped version of the series called Paula's Best Dishes, in which friends and family join her in the kitchen to prepare recipes. Deen's sons often appeared as guests on the show. They too proved to be popular among Food Network's audience and now have their own show, Road Tasted, similar to Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels. Deen's husband, Michael Groover, also appeared sporadically as a guest, and Food Network taped the Deen-Groover wedding in 2004 as a special edition of the show. The success of Paula's Home Cooking led to a line of cookbooks, a magazine, other television shows and specials, and related merchandise. Reruns of the show now air on Food Network's sister channel GAC.",

Paddle To The Ocean is a documentary film about using a banjo, a kayak and a bicycle to recover from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In 2011, Zac Crouse (musician, recreation therapist and expedition kayaker) toured his album 'You Plan To Do Nothing' from Ottawa ON to Halifax NS using only a sea kayak and a bicycle. It was a journey Zac had intended to do with his friend Corey; who sadly passed away while on a kayaking adventure with Zac in Nova Scotia. Paddle To The Ocean is a tribute to Zac's friend, but it also examines the stigma associated with mental illness while demonstrating the benefits of physical activity and music.",

        "description": "When Rehtaeh Parsons was 15 years old, she went to a party that would define her remaining teenage years. She was sexually attacked and had no memory of it, until photographic evidence spread through social media. The resulting humiliation and bullying the Nova Scotia teen received led to her tragic suicide less than two years later. News of her death reverberated worldwide, a stunning demonstration of the power of images and social networks to amplify the extent of rape culture and effects of depression. Now, her parents and those who knew her reassemble the pieces of Parsons’s life in their courageous quest to make accountable the systems that failed to protect her. With the support of Anonymous, an online campaign and public pressure, they forced the Nova Scotian government and RCMP to address the case and bring the perpetrators to justice. Parsons’s story epitomizes the immense capacity of new tools in these nascent years of social networking.",

It helped jump start the careers of several young performers including Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Eartha Kitt, Carol Lawrence, performer/writer Mel Brooks (as Melvin Brooks), and lyricist Sheldon Harnick. The film was basically a reproduction of the stage revue with a thin plot added. The plot involved a producer and performer (Ronny Graham) in financial trouble and is trying to stave off an angry creditor long enough to open his show.

Austin that the time for half-measures is past. Austin, responsible for bringing the Americans to Texas as colonists, reminds Wharton that a settler's revolt against Mexico would dishonor his name and the arrangements he had with the Mexican government. He gets the \"Whartonites\" to agree to a general convention of all colonists. Almerian Dickinson, biggest land owner in the settlement of Gonzales, deeply in love with his wife Anne, warns Wharton that a bloody revolt would endanger every wife and mother in the colony.

There is no precedent for The Stooges, while those inspired by them are now legion.

Extensive interviews reveal the political motivations for the lies, harassment and discrediting of UFO abductees and witnesses. Among the 36 world renowned UFO experts and whistleblowers are: the former prime minister of Canada the Honorable Paul Hellyer, President Carter's investigative consultants Daniel Sheehan and Alfred Webre, New York Times bestseller Jim Marrs, US Air Force Captain Robert Salas, Air Force Colonel/nuclear engineer Don Ware, UK Ministry of Defense spokesman Nick Pope, astronomer Jacques Vallee, professor/abduction researcher David Jacobs, nuclear physicist Stanton Friedman, and many more, including contactees and abductees.",

The holder of more patents than any other inventor in history, Edison had achieved glory as the genius behind such revolutionary inventions as sound recording, motion pictures, and electric light. Born on the threshold of America's burgeoning industrial empire, Edison's curiosity led him to its cutting edge. With just three months of formal schooling, he took on one seemingly impossible technical challenge after another, and through intuition, persistence, and a unique team approach to innovation, invariably solved it. Driven and intensely competitive, Edison was often neglectful in his private life and could be ruthless in business. Challenged by competition in the industry he'd founded, Edison launched an ugly propaganda campaign against his rivals, and used his credibility as an electrical expert to help ensure that high-voltage electrocution became a form of capital punishment.",

The only catch is, like all addicts, Paris' confidence completely relies on the drugs in his system and -- in this case -- his firm belief that he can succeed in his mission if he can just stay high 24/7 and alive long enough to see it through. To aid in the endeavor, Paris enlists the help of Maya Gibbs, an African American prostitute versed not only in the language of the street, but also in the words of Maya Angelou and Nadine Gordimer. And together, the path of this dysfunctional duo crosses with those of the child's parents, a doctor with a penchant for soliciting \"Street Boys\", a self-ascribed King Of Porn, a drug supplier with a gift for making impeccable hors d'oeuvres, and a hardened cop with more scams than the most adept street hustler.",

Equal parts human drama and speed, \"APEX\" follows Swedish entrepreneur Christian von Koenigsegg, a lifelong sports car enthusiast on a personal quest to build a \"mega\" car whose golden ratio defies all expectations for a hypercar's velocity and power, while competing against the biggest names in motorsports for space on the world stage. With insights from top engineers and designers, \"APEX\" pulls back the curtain on the top-secret development facilities at Porsche, Ferrari, McLaren and Pagani, where awe-inspiring hypercars are imagined and built, and puts you inches from the action, as top drivers shake down the latest hypercars, flat-out on some of the world's greatest racetracks.",

Having never met each other, the boys both individually promised that if Nino was ever separated from them, her voice would be the beacon to reunite them once again.\n\nAfter six long years, destiny has finally placed Nino, Momo, and Yuzu in the same high school. However, the passage of time has changed many things in their lives—while Nino relentlessly attempts to fulfill her childhood promise with the boys, Yuzu's feelings for her from the past resurface, and Momo goes to great lengths to prevent a reunion with Nino. Through music, will they be able to mend their friendship and overcome all the feelings involved in this complicated love triangle?",

In the weeks and months to follow, the monster (now known as The Mothman) was sighted again and again on country roads and around the state of West Virginia. As the sightings continued so did an increase in unusual activity.  At the center of this bizarre series of events was the town of Point Pleasant, WV. A small burb situated on the banks of the Ohio river with a lengthy history of what many might call bad luck.

The third is a shy bachelor car mechanic, just fired, who lives on a squalid sailboat . Theirs is the common tragedy of losing one's vocation, one's purpose in life. There's talk of sailing adventures, online dating, and a condo in Palm Springs, but these three live in common terror of the question, \"What's next for you?\" They know damn well what's next!

As some of the last of the still-living orphan train riders like to remind us, it was a different era - one that can't be judged without understanding what lives were like then. West by Orphan Train, a documentary film completed late in 2014, offers that understanding.",

Moving back in time through the 1940s into the maelstrom of the Blitz, the lives, loves and losses of these four central characters are unravelled.

Nat Turner: A Troublesome Property examines how the story of Turner’s revolt has been interpreted throughout history and how it continues to raise new questions about the nature of terrorism and other forms of violent resistance to oppression.  The film adopts an innovative structure by interspersing documentary footage and interviews with dramatizations of these different versions of Turner’s story. A unique collaboration between MacArthur Genius Award feature director Charles Burnett, acclaimed historian of slavery Kenneth S. Greenberg and Academy Award-nominated documentary producer Frank Christopher, Nat Turner is a compelling look at one of history’s most mysterious figures.",

During this trial and error phase, Jai realizes his dream. But his decision of choosing an unprofitable career path doesn’t go down too well with his father (Neeraj Sood), who has bigger aspirations for him. Therefore, in order to bring stability in his life, his father decides to get him married. Destiny, however, has something else in store for Jai, when he accidentally meets Avni (Kritika Kamra), an ambitious, MBA graduate, who wants to start her own business. Set in the backdrop of the Gujarati milieu, the film traces Jai and Avni’s personal journey, as they both find themselves and discover the true meaning of friendship in the bargain.",

        "description": "Abductions. Reproduction experiments. Memories of seeing children off-planet. The idea of humans participating in an alien hybrid program sounds absurd until you talk to people who have experienced it. Thousands of women and men around the world have had reproductive experiments carried out against their will. The most harrowing? Unexplained pregnancies that terminate without explanation. In many cases, the memories of what happened remain suppressed and fragmented, leaving experiencers confused, depressed and with a profound sense of loss. In others, the memories are visceral and emotionally disturbing. Thanks to increased public acceptance and regression therapy, more and more people are coming forward with stories of abductions and strange fertilization procedures that occur during their frightening experiences. Are aliens involved in a complex hybridization project where human females are used as vessels to carry hybrid fetuses and human males have their sperm harvested until they're ready to be transferred \"elsewhere?\" And if so, to what end? \"Extraordinary: The Seeding\" is a riveting documentary that tells these stories through one-on-one interviews with abductees-brave individuals willing to share intensely personal and emotional stories with the rest of the world. Through analysis with global ufology experts, the film also explores hybridization, why it's happening and what the impact on humanity is and will be. The information presented is intended to educate, entertain and encourage audiences to ask one simple question: What if this is all true?",

These children endured brutality, physical hardship, mental degradation, and the complete erasure of their culture.

These schools were established with the express purpose 'To kill the Indian in the child.'

It's Christmas time once again, and as usual Kevin (Moore) is scrambling to get his son Ben a last minute gift before stopping by his ex-wife Jill's house for a quick swig of eggnog. Ben can't stand Jill's impossibly perfect new boyfriend, and the prospect of spending the entire evening with his former inlaws is nearly too painful to ponder. But this Christmas things are going to be different, because this Christmas might just last forever. At first Kevin resists the curious development by simply reverting to his childish ways, though he is about to find out that sometimes in order to build a better future one must finally make amends with the past. ~ Jason Buchanan",

This incredibly elaborate (and surprisingly little-known) film traces the origins of Quilombo, which began as a community of freed slaves. The colony becomes a safe harbor for other outcasts of the world, including Indians and Jews. Ganga Zumba (Toni Tornado) becomes president of Quilombo, the first freely elected leader in the Western Hemisphere. Naturally, the ruling Portuguese want to subjugate Zumba and his followers, but the Quilombians are ready for their would-be oppressors. The end of this Brave New World is not pleasant, but the followers of Zumba and his ideals take to the hills, where they honor his memory to this day. Writer/director Carlos Diegues takes every available opportunity to compare the rise and fall of Quilombo with the state of affairs in modern-day Brazil.",

Built in the 1700's and made of stone, it is known by the townspeople as the \"Evan Straw\" house. She tells her visiting aunt, Gert, of it's history and they both take it lightly. As time goes on, strange things start to happen to Alice while she's in the house. Finally, she calls in a psychic medium, Leocardia Tomas, to try to contact the spirit. As the spirit becomes more erratic and threatening, a ghost hunter named Peter Yakov is summoned to get to the bottom of why Evan Straw still haunts the house.

The Queen's brother Narpat Singh has designs upon the throne and enrols his sister the Maharani in his plot, by promising to unseat Bhanu Pratap and install her son as the heir.

Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle based his book \"The Lost World\" (1912) about men and dinosaurs on the tales from early explorers to this plateau. This was the inspiration for Jurassic Park. The modern expedition team encounters the animals, people and extreme habitat on its route across the Gran Sabana and up the 9000 ft. mountain.

Six months ago, Duncan lost everything to heroin addiction: he spent time in prison, his wife took his daughters and left him, and his parents barely speak to him. His sister, Jessie, offers him support, but struggles to raise her children with an indifferent husband and pursue her own career. Brother and sister are caught between the disapproval of their parents, Ronald and Martha, and societal expectations: to sacrifice for their families. Duncan bounces back and forth from Narcotics Anonymous meetings, teaching at a local community college with a one-strike policy, and infant birthday parties to earn back his family's broken trust and prove that anyone can change. His soon-to-be ex-wife, Tonya, is forced to give Duncan an ultimatum - he must overcome his addiction and prove it, or risk never seeing his girls again. 'Lily is Here' is the story of a recovering heroin addict that, through a tragic family loss, discovers there are two dates for every addict: the date they became clean, and the date they go all in.",

Since nodding to Edward’s proposal, she has been pushed beyond limits by unaffordable housing, archaic customs, and intrusive in-laws. What befuddles her further is the reappearance of Shuwei, a mainlander she’s supposed to be divorced from out of a sham marriage that solved her coming-of-age hardship. Zeroing in on nuts and bolts of modern marriage, My Prince Edward pokes around fixated correlations of freedom with relationship status and geographic residence. Like a breath of fresh air out of the breathless space it navigates, the whimsical gem contributes a rare humane take on the worldly metropolis's divisions with humor and wisdom.",

When you live in a world where being slim is hailed as the ultimate standard of beauty, an intense passion for food feels a bit like a curse. Which is why, on more than one occasion, Xiao Xiao has wished she could have lived during the time of the Tang Dynasty, where plump women were considered to be the epitome of beauty. Tired of being harassed about her size, Xiao Xiao wishes with all her heart that she could transport back in time. Little does she know, her wishes are about to come true! After passing out in the modern world, Xiao Xiao finds herself possessing the body of Yuan Wan Er, a painfully thin Tang Dynasty girl whose frail form has kept away all the potential suitors away.",

After a mad night at a pub, a fun drive around the famous Gehri route and one peck on the cheek, Sameer ends up losing the car.

It's the fictional tale of a wayward 9th grader, Ralph (Adam Butcher), who is secretly living on his own while his widowed, hospitalized mother remains immersed in a coma. Frequently in trouble with Father Fitzpatrick (Gordon Pinsent), the principal of his all-boys, Catholic school, Ralph is considered something of a joke among peers until he decides to pull off a miracle that could save his mother, i.e., winning the Boston Marathon.  Coached by a younger priest and former runner, Father Hibbert (Campbell Scott), whose cynicism has been lifted by the boy's pure hope, Ralph applies himself to his unlikely mission, fending off naysayers and getting help along a very challenging path from sundry allies and friends.",

This is how Oei starts to help her father out in his painting of the “insurmountable high wall”. Meanwhile, Oei can only talk to the painter Ikeda Zenjiro, who is her father’s student, about her pain and worries. Zenjiro has taken Edo by storm as Keisai Eisen, the master of ukiyo-e portraying beautiful women. He visits regularly because he admires Hokusai and secretly likes Oei although their relationship is like childhood friends. Oei respects her father whose paintings fascinated her and continues to work as a painter who supports him behind the scenes. When Hokusai’s masterpiece Thirty-six Views of Mount Fuji was completed, she was also by his side.",

So began an accidental voyage into his past that paralleled his world tour and culminated in a moment of revelation about the source of his relentless drive.

Nowadays, Mia’s friends are not too keen on transforming this dilapidated summer camp into the wedding venue of her dreams. Mia’s wound a bit too tight and somewhat of a control freak. Her gay BFF has the hots for all the groomsmen and her maid of honor just wants good cellphone reception. Even worse, she accidentally sent an email invite to her annoying high school friend whom she hasn’t seen in years. But nothing will stop Mia from having a perfect wedding, not even when people begin disappearing in the night, and especially not when a spirit-possessed Teddy Ruxpin starts telling her to hide the bodies.",

Well, in consideration of the fact that having vestigial wings and a tail isn't a problem most teenage girls have to bear, one can perhaps cut our heroine a little slack.\n\nHowever, when Mink insists on compounding her difficulties to infinite proportions by falling in love with handsome pop star - and professional Dragon Slayer - Dick Saucer, she really has put her heart before her head!

Though a dead telephone line and bad weather prevents Sibyl from going anywhere. Black ice and a persisten snowstorm makes transportation an impossibility. Early in the morning, the woman dies from what they believe to be a stroke and in all the chaos, Sibyl promptly decides to do a C-section to save the baby. The baby survives, but the mother is dead and tragedy is obvious. Yet, it's only going to get worse for Sibyl as her assistant is certain that the woman was still alive when Sibyl performed the C-section.

I was a little surprised to see how well-made this thing was and there's no question that it's a better movie than the 2009 one but at the same time there are a few too many flaws to really call this a good picture.",

Forced into nearly two decades of no-holds-barred fights against other abductees inside an unearthly mixed martial arts arena, Trevor has evolved from an innocent boy into a brutal fighting machine. Derek, (Jeff Hatch) an ambulance chasing lawyer, is the latest lab-rat abductee forced to fight Trevor. As the two men exchange ever-increasing beating over the course of weeks and months, the brutality of their existence and the true nature of their humanity is slowly revealed. With elements of THE TWILIGHT ZONE and THE PRISONER, BRUTAL explores through science fiction, allegory and psychological drama, man’s violent nature and our propensity to commit unthinkable acts of violence against each other. Yet through this prism of brutality our capacity to love one another, even in the worst of circumstances is celebrated.",

With the mysterious death of his father, Jimmy's mother, Agnes, becomes disconnected to her children and finds refuge in the local bars and the men who visit them. She selfishly falls deep into a world of alcoholism, casual sex, and denial. After frequent conflicts with their mother, Colette, Jimmy's older sister, leaves the home to marry her sweetheart. Jimmy is left to decide to stay and support his mother and younger brother Vincent or leave town as well. As he wrestles with a decision, Jimmy stumbles upon a small town about 15 miles away from his own and is exposed to a very diverse group of extraordinary people. He is humbled by their generosity, but reluctant to accept them for their differences. Until tragedy strikes. It will be up to Jimmy to find a way to save the only group of people who have given him an opportunity to better his life. Along with his mother Agnes, Jimmy finds the strength and hope to redeem his past relationships and forgive his mother for her short comings. This is a story of hope, a story of struggle, but a story of how, as humans, we each have the instinct of good. Sometimes it just takes a fresh perspective of the world around us.",

How could she say such a thing? Six months later the three are each facing defining moments in their lives. One is struggling to be more than simply \"the beauty\" and failing miserably. Another faces a career change and extracurricular explorations. And the third faces a complete change in lifestyle as she prepares to have a baby -- alone. Trials ensue, but ultimately the three women are able to define themselves and their friendship beyond a one-dimensional view of beauty, brains, and personality. The three realize that though they may be just fine on their own, they are stronger, braver, and happier together.",

Growing up in an ex-mining village in County Durham, Jamie has already faced his fair share of difficulties after coming out as gay at 14. However, with the majority of his family and friends being supportive, he has decided that he is ready to share his passion with the world. He plans to embrace who he really is by attending his end of school prom in drag, but he doesn't get the reaction he'd hoped for from both his school and his own father. Jamie has to make some difficult decisions. Jamie spends time with an established drag artist and battles his demons, performing as his alter ego, Fifi La True, for the very first time in front of a large audience. As Jamie has some frank and intimate family moments, and finds out just how strong he really is, the film explores his hopes and fears for the future. Will he get the acceptance he craves from his peers and the confidence to be who he really is?",

We do not choose to exist, or the environment we grow up in. Our starting point in life is one of passive reliance on forces over which we have no control. THE LOTTERY OF BIRTH shows that from birth onwards our minds are a battleground of competing forces: familial, educational, cultural, and professional. The outcome of this battle not only determines who we become, but the society that we create.",

Mother of a liberal Viennese patchwork family, Wanda is appalled; she has always strongly stood against religious fanaticism. However, all attempts to make Nina see reason fail. To make matters worse, Wanda’s ex-husband has just fathered a child with his latest wife, and Wanda begins to yearn for a time when her only problems were her daughter’s truancy and pot smoking. When she meets Hanife, the mother of Nina's Muslim girlfriend, she finds an ally. Hanife, who immigrated to Austria as a child, is determined to save her daughter from the extremely old-fashioned image of women, which Nina is enthusiastically preaching. Eva Spreitzhofer's culture-clash comedy negotiates a highly topical theme with playful ease.",

The group is as diverse as the city: there’s a young man on drugs, an arguing couple, a woman with prayer beads and a girl who has just fallen in love. And behind the wheel sits the chatty driver. But as the bus emerges from a tunnel, everything is suddenly quite still: the streets and buildings are all empty and there’s not a soul to be seen; it’s as if everyone has suddenly been swallowed by the earth. Only the millions of neon lights continue to blink, as if nothing has happened. The eclectic group of passengers seek refuge in a deserted café and discuss what they should do. Then they make an horrific discovery…",

Nearly 95% of these were women. These chilling words appear at the beginning of the feature, THE HUMAN SOLUTION. Based on historical facts and set in 1938-1953 Sweden, this fictional story is a harrowing family drama that explores eugenics through the eyes of a Swedish doctor, August Persson, who performed the procedures. When his estranged wife dies in childbirth, leaving behind a half-Roma baby girl, August's life is turned upside down by his decision to raise her himself.",
