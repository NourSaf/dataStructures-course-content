    "## Using Python \n",
    "Welcome to Python! Python is a programming language that is particularly powerful for dealing with multiple text documents, running statistics, and running machine learning algorithms (and much much more!). There are many libraries and extensions of Python that make it a very effective and useful language.\n",

    "*Introducing Python* by Bill Lubanovic is the rare good, clear introduction to the language and to programming in general.\n",

    "*Python Crash Course* by Eric Matthes gives you a project based introduction, I have heard good things from those who have used this book.\n",
